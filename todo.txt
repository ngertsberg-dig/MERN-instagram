bcrypt sign up passwords
refactor <App>... way too much code in it
upload to cloudinary seperate folder
Make a not ugly design :P
make a .env file for database connection and cloudinary api keys..


done:
Image uploads with cloudinary
in client/src/components/PhotoCrop/ProfilePicCrop when a user uploads a new profile pic it forces the window to refresh with to catch the updated image... find a way to change the state instead..
